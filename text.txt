So	far,	weâ€™ve	purposely	kept	things	small	and	simple	in	order	to	understand	the	mechanics	of	module
creation	and	the	associated	tooling.	However,	the	real	magic	happens	when	you	compose	multiple
modules.	Only	then	the	advantages	of	the	module	system	become	apparent.
It	would	be	rather	boring	to	extend	our	Modular	Hello	World	example.	Therefore,	we	continue	with	a
more	interesting	example	application	called	EasyText.	Starting	from	a	single	monolithic	module,	we
gradually	create	a	multimodule	application.	EasyText	may	not	be	as	big	as	your	typical	enterprise
application	(fortunately),	but	it	touches	enough	real-world	concerns	to	serve	as	a	learning	vehicle.
